# VHDLreference
VHSIC Hardware Description Language (VHDL) is a hardware description language (HDL). This reference material makes for a good head-start.

My typical workflow is as follows:
1. Start with tables (logic, truth, etc.) as necessary. [Logic Friday](https://download.cnet.com/logic-friday/3000-20415_4-75848245.html) or equivalent can be a great help at this stage.
2. Write pseudo code on paper.
3. Copy the material from the General folder into a code editor (like VSCode).
4. Add/modify General code as necessary.
5. Copy the code into [Xilinx ISE Design Suite](https://www.xilinx.com/support/download/index.html/content/xilinx/en/downloadNav/vivado-design-tools/archive-ise.html) (running in a VM) or other software of choice...

The entity_arch_ports were provided as an intro to VHDL and can be referenced from [link](https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~traylor/ece474/vhdl_lectures/entity_arch_ports.pdf).
