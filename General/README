Start with the General.vhd. Usually one architecture method will be used: dataflow, behavioral, structural, or mixed. 
1. Dataflow: signal assignment statements are executed concurrently.
2. Behavioral: signal assignment statements are countained between process and end process and execute sequentially.
3. Structural: interconnected components, usually with no process block. Components should be written in seperate files and then imported.
4. Mixed: a combination of two or more architecture methods.
*When using General.vhd, delete the other unusued architecture types.

In General.vhd, any code that is within square brackets is optional. 
For example [signals: mode type := initial value] is a general syntax that should be replaced with defined parameters, or can be deleted entirely.
